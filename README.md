## Project Overview
This is a simple full-stack web application developed as part of an intern technical assignment.  
It consists of a backend API and a frontend UI that work together and are deployed on the cloud.

## 1. How I Developed This Application

I developed the application by separating it into backend and frontend components.

- The **backend** was built using a REST API that returns a hardcoded list of facts in JSON format through an endpoint (`/api/facts`).
- The **frontend** was developed to fetch data from the backend API and display the list of facts in a simple user interface.
- Both backend and frontend were deployed on cloud hosting using a free tier so that they are publicly accessible.
- GitHub was used for version control, and the project follows a clean folder structure.
